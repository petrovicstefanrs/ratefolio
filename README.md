# RateFolio

You can checkout the ***live version*** of this project [here](https://ratefolio.petrovicstefan.rs).

###### Description

This is a repo for the **RateFolio** platform. 
It is a simple platform for new and seasoned developers to host their portfolios or any other project and get feedback.

Platform was built on with **React** and **Firebase**
Some of the features use **Imgur API** and **Disqus API**

**STACK:**

- React
- Firebase

###### Inspiration

Inspired by a random thread on a Facebook group, where developers share opinions and feedback. It seemed like this kind of platform would benefit some of the new guys on the dev scene looking for feedback on their projects.
